      "Explanation: The text provides some descriptive elements, such as the use of figurative language (\"drop of, like, 68%\", \"brunt of climate change\") and suggestions for actions (\"enjoying more plant-based meals or snacks\"). However, the text is also somewhat concise, focusing on conveying the message rather than providing elaborate descriptions. The hint towards a farm animal that rhymes with \"wow\" adds a touch of descriptiveness, but this is not pursued further in the text.\n",

      "\n",
      "The text is written in English and uses appropriate grammar and vocabulary, with the exception of some informal language like \"Y'know\" and \"That's huge!\", but these do not significantly affect the fluency of the text.\n",

      "score\\_comprehensibility=3,\n",
      "\n",
      "The text is clear, easy to understand, and makes sense, with a coherent message and logical flow. The use of informal language and rhetorical questions adds to the comprehensibility of the text by making it more engaging and accessible to the reader. The reference to a \"farm animal that's just awful for the climate, and it kinda rhymes with 'wow'\" may be slightly confusing to some readers, but the overall meaning of the text is still comprehensible.\n",
