Explanation: The conversational styles of these two paragraphs are very different. Paragraph S1 is written in an informal, colloquial style, using phrases like ""I'm all about that grub"" and ""just before hitting the books."" It is a monologue about the speaker's eating habits and upcoming plans. On the other hand, Paragraph S2 is written in a fragmented style, consisting of several short questions and statements that do not appear to be related to each other. It is more like a rapid-fire exchange of ideas or a series of unconnected thoughts. Overall, the styles of these two paragraphs are almost completely different."
