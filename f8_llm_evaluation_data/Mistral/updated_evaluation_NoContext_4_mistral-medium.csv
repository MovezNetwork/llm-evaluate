Explanation: The conversational style in T1 and T2 differ significantly in terms of semantics and syntax. In T1, the author expresses their food preferences using exclamatory sentences and positive affirmations (""I usually start my week with some beans and vegan sausage before heading off to school. I'm all about that food!""). In contrast, T2 consists of a series of unrelated questions and statements that vary in length and tone. For instance, ""Any movies or series that you have been watching lately?"" is an open-ended question, while ""Oh escape room is nice!"" is a declarative sentence with a positive connotation. In terms of syntax, T1 follows a more structured pattern with a clear subject and verb, while T2 varies in sentence structure and complexity. Additionally, there are no emojis used in T1, whereas T2 does not contain any emojis either, but the difference in tone and style is still significant enough to warrant a score of 7 on a scale of 1-10."
