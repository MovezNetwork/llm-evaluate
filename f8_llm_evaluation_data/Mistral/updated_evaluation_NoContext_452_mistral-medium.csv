Explanation: The conversational styles in T1 and T2 are quite different. While T1 employs an informal and casual register, with colloquial expressions such as ""you know?"" and ""soy burger,"" T2 is more varied in its style, ranging from informal (e.g., ""You remember Tonka put her name on a random mug?"") to more formal (e.g., ""i think these will be very good matches, two teams of similar strength""). The use of punctuation also varies between the two texts, with T1 using contractions and exclamation points, while T2 uses semicolons to separate sentences and generally adheres to more conventional grammar and punctuation rules. There are no emojis used in either text, so they do not factor into the score.

Overall, the syntax and semantics of T1 and T2 differ significantly, resulting in a score of 7 on a scale of 1 to 10, with 1 being completely identical styles and 10 being completely different styles."
